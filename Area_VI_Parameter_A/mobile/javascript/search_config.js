Section 3. Finance                                a.  Sources  of  Funds.    Financial  resources  are  generated  through  grants,                                    donations, bilateral agreements and collaborations with government and non-                                   government  agencies  private  institutions,  foreign  funding  institutions  and                                   other agencies and councils.                                            There are two major classifications of fund sources: the internal and                                   external  funds.  The  internal  funds  come  from  the  general  appropriation                                    allocation  (GAA)  of  the  Philippine  government.  The  Center  also  generates                                   fund from various income generating projects of the University and a portion                                    of which is allocated for the conduct of the University’s extension activities.","16                                    On the other hand, the  external  funds can come from  government  agencies                                    such as  Department  of  Agriculture  (DA), Department  of  Interior  and  Local                                   Government  (DILG),  Department  of  Agriculture  -  Agricultural  Training                                    Institute (DA-ATI),  Department  of  Agrarian  Reform  (DAR),  Department  of                                   Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Local Government Unit (LGUs)                                    and  others  as  well  as  private  individuals  and  institutions  both  in  the                                   Philippines and abroad.                                 b.

External  grants  are  treated  as  trust  funds.  Funds  are  released  to  the                                   Accounting  Department  by  project  allotment  whereby  project/study  leaders                                   handle the processing of papers to release the fund meant for their extension                                    projects/studies in coordination with the Extension Services Director.

Extension Grant Opportunities                                    Section 1.1. CvSU  Extension Grant.   Cavite  State  University  (CvSU) has                                   trilogy  of  functions  –  instruction,  research,  and  extension.  All  the  three                                    functions of the University stand in a tripod in order to attain its mission of                                   educating future leaders, expanding knowledge, and developing technological                                    innovations and provide services to the community.                                           Extension is very significant in the promotion of research outputs for                                    national  development.  Without  extension,  information  and  technologies                                   developed  and  produced  by  the  University  would  not  be  able  to  reach  its                                    target beneficiaries.","18                                            Recently,  the  Commission  on  Higher  Education  (CHED)  is                                    strengthening  the  extension  function  of  the  Higher  Education  Institutions                                   (HEIs).  In  fact,  the  Commission  has  Grant-In-Aids  (GIA)  for  extension                                    programs  and  projects.  Aside  from  CHED,  other  institutions  such  as                                   Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DOST)  and  Department  of                                    Agriculture (DA) provide grants for extension.                                           To  better  reinforce  the  extension  function  of  the  University,  the                                    creation of the CvSU Extension Grant is proposed. The grant aims to produce                                   high quality and relevant extension projects for the promotion of community                                   development.                                            The  CvSU  Extension  Grant  shall  give  priority  to  extension  projects                                   which are: aligned with the University Research and Extension Agenda; based                                    on  the  needs  of  the  community;  utilize  University  research  outputs;                                   multidisciplinary; and apply appropriate extension approaches, strategies and                                    methods.                                       Section 1.1.1. Objectives of the CvSU Extension Grant                                       1.  To  promote  and  encourage  faculty  and  staff  to  conduct  relevant                                            extension  activities  and/or  public  service  work  in  line  with                                           institutional, regional, national, and global thrusts;                                        2.  To  provide  financial  support  for  extension  projects  that  receive                                           minimal funds; and                                        3.  To strengthen the extension function of the University.","19                                        Section  1.1.2.  Amount  of  Grant.
