When this was converted into Don Severino Agricultural                    College  (DSAC)  in  1964,  extension  became  one  of  the  functions  of  this  institution,  in                     addition to instruction and research. DSAC started with two major units, the Secondary                    Department and the College Department. The latter conducted extension services in the                    form of seminars on improved farm practices and certified seeds and veterinary services                     to the animals of the service area. In addition, the College maintained a one-and-a-half                    hectare nursery for the propagation of and multiplication of important plants for on-campus                    and for farmers’ use. The Swine Project which  was used for instruction purposes also                     served as source of foundation stock for farmers. Boar services were made available to                    small hog raisers for the improvement of their stock (DSAC Annual Report, SY 1968-69).                      Article 1.

Policies, Guidelines and Procedures                          Section 1. Extension Program/Project Planning and Implementation                       a)  The  planning  and  implementation  of  the  extension  activities  of  the  university  is                           decentralized, integrated, coordinated, participatory and needs-based. The extension                            program support the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of the United Nations,                           the national, regional, provincial and local development plans.                       b)  Colleges  and  branch  campuses  plan  and  implement  their  respective  extension                            programs  in  coordination  with  the  University  Extension  Services.  The  process  is                           participatory involving the stakeholders which include the target clients, the students,                           alumni,  faculty  members,  representatives  of  government  and  non-government                            agencies  and  other  concerned  individuals.  The  needs  and  concerns  of  these                           stakeholders  are  considered  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the  extension                            programs.                       c)  The different colleges/branch campuses and the Extension Services apply the different                           strategies  for  identifying  the  needs.  These  include  survey,  focus  group  interviews,                           experts’ contributions, direct participation of the target clients in the planning process,                            and the use of secondary data.                       d)  Decentralization  of  the  planning  process  shall  start  at  the  department  level.  The                            colleges integrate all the planned extension programs of their respective departments                           into  one  Research,  Development  and  Extension  Agenda  and  Programs  (RDEAP).                           There is a designated RD and E coordinator at the department level (depending on                            the size of the department) and at the college level. The college RD and E Coordinator                           under the direct supervision of the Dean consolidates and prepares the RDEAP.                            Section 2.

In this process, identification and selection of research and extension thrusts                            are guided by the stated vision and mission of the university/college/campus. Likewise,                           the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), national and provincial, municipal and                            local development goals are considered.                       c)  The  research,  development  and  extension  (RDE)  thrusts  resulting  from  the  latest                           (2004) RDEAP planning workshops include: poverty alleviation, food security, primary                            health  care  and  public  health,  alternative  medicine,  cultural  heritage  preservation,                           ecosystem management, energy conservation and utilization, institutional capability                           building,  information  and  communication  technology,  infrastructure  planning  and                            design,  bio-technology,  industrial  technology,  pedagogy/andragogy,  gender  and                           development,  coffee,  pineapple,  banana,  kaong,  makapuno,  herbs  and  spices,                           ornamentals, and urban agriculture.                            Section 3. Presentation of RDEAP by College                       a)   Prior  to  the  actual  conduct  of  RDEAP  planning  workshop,  the  RDE  Coordinators                             present  their  draft  plans  with  their  respective  Deans  for  further  comments  and                            suggestions.  During  the  workshop,  the  RDE  Coordinators  polish  their  prepared                            Agenda. As part of the workshop, the RDEAP of the different Colleges/Campuses are                             presented to the RECETS Council for comments and suggestions.                               Also, during the presentation of various agenda and programs by College/Campus,                            duplication of plans and programs are eliminated. In cases where similar areas of                             concerns  are  presented  by  two  or  more  Colleges,  either  one  party  will  drop  its                            proposed knowledge area or integrate such with the others of similar nature. Also,                            group members openly discuss and decide as to who would lead the implementation                             of such programs.                       b)   Deans  endorse  the  corrected  copy  of  their  RDEAPs  to  Research  Center  for                             consolidation. RDE Coordinators incorporate the comments and suggestions made                            during the presentation. The Deans submit the corrected copy to the Research Center                            Council for consolidation.                                ❖  Research  Center  collects  the  RDEAPs  of  the  different  colleges.

Section 4. Preparation of Extension Project Proposals                        ❖  Call for capsule proposals. Office of the Director for Extension calls for the submission                            of an extension proposal. Although the extension has its own format, format shall be                             based on the requirement of the funding agency and in case that the fund shall come                            from the university, the proposal should follow the extension format.                        ❖  College/Campuses  prepare  capsule  proposals.  Faculty  members  of  the  different                             colleges with varied fields of specialization prepare capsule proposal on their areas                            of  expertise  and  interest.  The  proposal  maybe  singly  prepared  or  in  cooperation                             (interdisciplinary approach) with other extensionists. The proposals are in line with the                            approved RDEAP. Capsule proposals are reviewed at the department level to the                            college levels by the respective research and extension committee in coordination                             with RDE Coordinator.                        ❖  Deans endorse capsule proposals to URDE Council through the Extension Director.                            The reviewed proposals are then endorsed to the URDEC through the Director for                             approval.                        ❖  URDEC reviews and approves the capsule proposals. All the extension proposals                            must be reviewed and approved by the URDEC prior to their implementation.                         ❖  URDEC  endorses  the  approved  proposals  for  University  or  external  funding.                            Proposals requiring bigger funding are usually submitted to external funding institution                             while the remaining projects are recommended for local funding.                        ❖  Extension Director prepares work and financial plans for approved projects. Extension                            Director considers the newly approved proposals in the preparation of their annual                             work and financial plan.

Program/project  leaders  implement  their  approved  projects  at  their  respective                           colleges/campuses in coordination with RECETS. While the University has RECETS                            that  is  in-charge  of  the  research  and  extension  functions,  the  planning  and                           implementation of research and extension projects is decentralized but unified up to                            the  department  level.  This  approach  has  been  institutionalized  and  exemplified  in                           CvSU through the concept called UGNAYAN.                      Article 11. Monitoring and Evaluation                    Monitoring  continuously  tracks performance  against  what  was  planned  by  collecting  and                     analyzing  data  on  the  indicators  established  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  purposes.  It                      provides continuous information on whether progress is being made toward achieving results                     (outputs,  outcomes  and  goals)  through  record  keeping  and  regular  reporting  systems.                     Monitoring looks at both programmed processes and changes in conditions of target groups                      and  institutions  brought  about  by  programmed  activities.  It  also  identifies  strengths  and                     weaknesses  in  a  programmed.  The  performance  information  generated  from  monitoring                      enhances  learning  from  experience  and  improves  decision-making.  Management  and                     programmed implementers typically conduct monitoring.                    Evaluation is a periodic, in-depth analysis of programmed performance. In relies on data                      generated through monitoring activities as well as information obtained from other sources                     (e.g.,  studies,  research,  in-depth  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  surveys  etc.).                     Evaluations are often (but not always) conducted with the assistance of external evaluators                      (UNFPA, 2004).                 Section 1. Monitoring Strategies                  a)  Mechanisms and Processes                    1.  Creation of the University Research, Development and Extension Council (URDEC)                         The Council is composed of the Research and Extension Directors and selected faculty                     members  who  are  considered  experts  in  their  respective  fields.  The  Vice  President  for                     Research Development and Extension chair this council. The University President designates                      the members of the URDEC.                        The Council primarily reviews research and extension policies, guidelines, programs and                      projects. In relation to monitoring and evaluation, the group acts as Panel of Reviewers during                           Area VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                         the Extension Agency In-House Review. They review and evaluate various on-going and                      completed extension programs/projects and activities of the different colleges and branch                     campuses.                    2.  Appointment/Assignment  of  the  Research,  Development  and  Extension  (RDE)                         Coordinators for the different colleges and campuses.                               Each of the Colleges and branch Campuses assigns Research, Development and                         Extension (RD and E) Coordinator. The main role of these coordinators is to coordinate                        and monitor the research and extension activities in their respective colleges/campuses.                        He or she serves as the point person and as conduit to other units/agencies, both internal                         and  external  in  matters  pertaining  to  research  and  extension  activities.  RD  and  E                        coordinator under the guidance of the Dean prepares the Research, Development and                        Extension Agenda of the college/campus.                     3.  CvSU Extension Agency Annual In-House Review                        The stated goals and objectives of this Review are as follows:                        Goals: The annual agency in-house review for extension aims to:                            ❖  Establish an additional institutional mechanism for the monitoring and evaluation                               of the different extension programs/projects/activities (E-PPAs) of the Cavite State                                University system;                           ❖  Increase faculty and staff participation in extension and outreach activities;                           ❖  Acquire papers on CvSU extension services which are acceptable for publication                                on appropriate Journals;                           ❖  Improve techniques, strategies and/or approaches in extension;                           ❖  Assess the attainment of objective of the College/University completed and on-                                going extension; and                           ❖  Identify  problems  met  during  project  implementation  and  recommend  specific                               courses of action to these problems;                         Objectives: Also, this activity aims to:                           ❖  Encourage faculty and staff to write their extension works and outputs;                            ❖  Present the extension activities of the different colleges and campuses;                           ❖  Recognize and award commendable extension programs, projects and activities;                           ❖  Document results of extension programs, projects and activities;                            ❖  Acquire effective and innovative techniques and/or strategies in extension.                       The mechanics of Extension In-House Review are indicated in Appendix 1.                              Area VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                        4.  Meetings – Dean or Director conducts regular meetings with their unit heads and/or staff                         to monitor the planned and on-going activities including that of extension matters.                               The  Director  of  Extension  services  coordinates  and  monitors  the  extension                        activities of the different colleges primarily through meetings with the different Research,                         Development and Extension (RDE) Coordinators.                    5.  Field Visits – All faculty members and staff engaged in extension activities are conducting                         regular field’s visits to their respective service areas. In the UGNAYAN service area of the                        CvSU main campus, the RD and E Coordinators either go in group or individually.                    6.  Accomplishment Reports – The Extension Services regularly submits monthly, weekly                         and daily  accomplishment  reports  to  the  concerned  offices.  At  the  end  of  the  year,  a                        Performance Accomplishment Report (PAR) is submitted to the Office of the President                        through  the  RECETS  office.  This  PAR  compares  the  year  accomplishments  vis-à-vis                         targeted activities.                    7.  Telephone calls – The presence of modern technologies like the cell phones make it easy                        to  contact  and  collect  information  and  updates  from  RD  and  E  Coordinators,  faculty                         extentionists and clients.                    8.  Memorandum  and  Other  Written  Communication  –  The  Conventional  methods  of                         monitoring projects are through memoranda and other written communication, e.g. letters.                    a.

Evaluation Strategies                     a)  Mechanisms and Processes                               The  University  has  established  mechanisms  and  processes  by  which  regular                        monitoring and evaluation of extension services and resources are ensured. As mentioned                         earlier, these include designation of RDE Council and RDE Coordinators; and the conduct                        of yearly in-house review.                              Area VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                                   The Extension Services has just introduced the logical framework approach (LFA)                         or concept in the evaluation of extension programs and projects. It has adopted the use                        of Logical Framework Model (Appendix 2) in the presentation of papers during the In-                        House Review. This model is able to represent the different types of evaluation.                        b)  Types of Evaluation                               There are different kinds of approaches to evaluation, based on when it occurs                         (process vs. outcome), the intentions of the evaluator (formative vs. summative), and who                        does the evaluation (internal vs. external).                               Evaluations maybe conducted at any of several phases of program development                         and implementation. Process and outcome evaluations relate to the phase of the program                        studied.  Process  evaluations  examine  what  goes  on  inside  the  program  while  it  is  in                        progress, focusing on such things as activities offered, staff practices, and client actions.                         Evaluating  program  processes  may  be  very  helpful  in  understanding  why  program                        objectives  are  or  are  not  met.  Outcome  evaluations  put  emphasis  on  the  program                        objectives or outcomes: what happens to clients as a result of their participation in the                         program. The processes and outcome evaluations may either be formative or summative,                        depending on the intentions of the evaluator (or those who hire the evaluator).                                Program  sponsors  and  taxpayers  typically  are  interested  in  program                        accountability,  which  calls  for  summative  evaluation.  Summative  evaluation  helps  to                        answer the question, “Is the program earning its keep?” and provides information which                         can be used to help program sponsors make informed decisions about program funding.                        In comparison, a person who implement programs are often more interested in learning                        how  to  improve  their  programs.  Program  improvement  is  the  purpose  of  formative                         evaluation. When an organization has an evaluator or evaluation team on staff to evaluate                        their  own  programs,  this  is  considered  internal  evaluation.  External  evaluations  are                        conducted  by  outside  by  outside  evaluation  organizations  or  independent  evaluators                         (PREL).                               With  the  use  of  Logical  Framework  Approach  in  the  In-House  Review,  CvSU                         Extension Services performs process and outcome evaluations, formative and summative                        evaluations  (ongoing  and  completed  projects)  and  considered  internal  and  external                        evaluator as stated in the approved proposal.

RATIONALE                      Cavite State University aims to deliver quality instructions, conducts relevant research and                contributes significant activities by playing substantial role in the community. A well planned and                essential extension programs must be extended to the community for economic and community                empowerment.  The Cavite State University Trece Martires City would like to impart programs                and  activities  that  will  help  area  development,  people  empowerment,  gender  equality  and                development in the community.                     Extension livelihood programs to be offered were identified based on the result of the needs                analysis conducted last 2014 and on the results of consultation with the barangay officials of Bgy.                San Agustin, Trece Martires City, Cavite.                     The population of Trece Martires City has shown tremendous increase of an average of                16.46% per annum. From 41,653 in year 2000, the city’s population has reached to 104,559 in                year 2010.  Migration of residents from Metro Manila particularly those who were relocated has                become the major reason of such increase.                     Despite of the growing economy of the city, the proponent perceives some risks that need to                be addressed proactively, and opportunities to be strengthened.                     Migration, particularly those relocated from Metro Manila, has become the major factor of                population  increase  in  Trece  Martires  City.  For  instance,  the  situation  in  the  city  could  be                worsened  by  limited  job  vacancies  with the  increasing  population  in  the area.  The  extension                program aims to alleviate poverty situation of some households in the area, maximize capacities                and further boost income by equipping them to actively contribute to production and labor markets                by making use of available resources and accessible markets.                     In addition, information technology plays a big role with this modern era.  Much of what people                              st                use in the 21  century such as communication devices, information storage devices, linkages                devices,  was  created  with  the  help  of  information  technology.    Information  Technology  has                allowed business, even small-scale, to keep up with the supply and demand of the consumers.                The  proposed  extension  program  will  provide  Seminar-Workshop  on  the  basic  promotional                materials preparation. This seminar-workshop will be facilitated by the Department of Computer                Studies of the campus.                     Furthermore,  gender  equality  has  been  an  important  aspect  of  development,  reflecting                internationally  agreed  upon  principles  of  human  rights  and  equity.    It  is  always  the  interest                particularly among women that gender equality is achieved.                     Republic Act 7192 Women in Development and Nation Building Act known as The Magna                Carta of Women recognize the economic, political, and socio-cultural realities affect women’s                condition.    This  extension  program  promotes  empowerment,  pursue  equal  opportunities  and                ensure  equal  access  to  resources  for  women.  This  extension  program  hopes  to  address                discrimination  and  inequality  in  the  economic  life  or  women  by  providing  livelihood  program.                Moreover, this extension program supports the Gender-Responsive Development Plan of the                Philippines that rests on a vision of development that is equitable, sustainable, free from violence,                respectful  of  human  rights,  supportive  of  self-determination  and  the  actualization  of  human                potentials,  and  participatory  and  empowering  of  women.    This  is  also  in  response  with  the                Sustainable Livelihood Program of the Department of Social Welfare and Development of the City                (2014) which aims to improve socio-economic status of the participants by equipping them to                actively contribute to production and labor markets by making use of available resources and                accessible markets.                     The TMK sa TMC hopes to cover poverty alleviation, additional technical knowledge and                skills and promote gender equality within the community of Trece Martires City.

Poverty Alleviation                                Migration, particularly those relocated from Metro Manila, has becomes the major                         factor of population increase in Trece Martires City could be exacerbated by limited job                         vacancies  relatively  to  suffice  the  increased  and  continuously  increasing  human                         population in the area. The Extension Programs aim to alleviate poverty situation of some                         households in the area, maximize capacities and further boost income.                     2.  Information and Communication Technology                                In the modern day, information technology plays a big role.

Gender and Development                               Gender  equality  has  been  an  important  aspect  of  development,  reflecting                         internationally agreed upon principles of the human rights and equity.

Osorio                 Target Client:  The unemployed and under privilege of two barangays who are chosen based on                the needs assessment are the target clients of the extension program. This can be an income                generating project for the partcipants.                        Students,  faculty  members  and  staff  of  Cavite  State  University  –  Trece  Martires  City                Campus are also the target clients; they will be involved in extension of the university.                 Phase of the Program:                     1.  Community Needs Assessment                   An assessment of the status, needs and conditions in Trece Martires City was conducted                during the second semester of 2014-2015. A community needs assessment (CNA) was done to                have baseline information of the people in the barangay and identify their problems and needs.                The activity enabled the campus to determine programs, design frameworks and plan activities                that will address the needs of the people in the community. It also helped the campus to identify                           Area VI: Extension and Community Involvement","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                    possible approximate interventions or solutions that can be implemented to help improve the                barangay. Among communities, Bgy. Osorio is one that have willingness to support extension in                their area. In addition, Bgy Osorio is the next immediate community to the campus in terms of                location after Bgy. Gregorio.                        As a result, the extension program will focus more on unemployment, skills training, and                gender development.                        Needs assessment result shows that majority of the residents in both barangays prioritized                Livelihood program and Pagpapalagong Perang Kinita (pls. see attached). With these problems                and  issues,  the  campus  planned  to  implement  a  total  of  five  major  activities  that  shall  be                conducted to address the needs of the adopted communities.                     2.  Consultation with the faculty members and clientele and LGU                        Consultative  meetings  with  the  faculty  and  staff  and  representatives  of  the  adopted                community  were  conducted.  The  meeting  was  attended  by  two  faculty  members  from  Trece                Campus (Ms. Pamela Daphne R. Busog and Mr. Gideon Luke P. Ty) while two representatives                from the partner barangay was also present. This aims to lead into a more effective and vibrant                extension programs. Through the collaborative efforts of different stakeholders, the formulated                programs  can  be  maximized  in  order  to  enhance  skills  to  different  communities  within  Trece                Martires City.                     3.  Presentation of proposals                        The extension proposal underwent through a series of analysis, critiquing and revisions                based on the CNA results before coming with the final output. The proposal was submitted to the                Extension Director Office, was returned twice for improvement before allowed to be presented to                the academic council meeting for the approval and budget allocation.                        The proposal was also presented to the Gender and Development Focal Point System of                the University during the seminar/workshop using gender analysis tools for possible funding. The                livelihood program was already included in the approved Gender and Development budget.                        The proposal was also presented to LGU Trece Martires City for evaluation and possible                partnership in each program components.                     4.
